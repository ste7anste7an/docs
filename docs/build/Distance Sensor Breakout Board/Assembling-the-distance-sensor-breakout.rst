Assembly of the distance sensor breakout board
==============================================

-  The 0.05 inch header goes on the backside, that's the side without
   rx/tx marking
-  The angled headers go on rx/tx and gnd/3v3 and face inward. The
   headers go on the front of the board
-  You're free to leave M+ and M- open, or solder any header you want
   there. These leads will give you 0-8V depending on the pwm setting
   you make for that port in the LEGO hub.
